# TODO

abs vs rel path - allow optino to fix

timing tests 

allow other types besides simple/complex source

remove individual sources from a band

builtins - how to use?

understand how it works with multiple files

invalid pixel function will cause problems - add automated checks?

pull band info from other band/vrt 

add no data - currently a blind spot

allow for vrt creation from input tif path - this requires gdal as a dep, maybe not

add vsis3 capabilities?

no data value - especially between bands

add band source just by index?
